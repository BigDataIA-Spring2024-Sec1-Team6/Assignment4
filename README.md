# Assignment4

## Problem Statement 

Develop an automated data processing pipeline to extract content and metadata from PDF files, validate the data, and load it into a Snowflake database, enabling query responses through a web application.

## Project Goals

1. **Automate PDF Data Handling**: Create a reliable, automated pipeline for extracting and processing data from PDF files.
2. **Integrate Cloud Storage and Processing**: Use AWS S3 for storage and Airflow for orchestrating the pipeline.
3. **Implement Data Validation**: Ensure data quality through validation checks before loading into the database.
4. **Develop API Services**: Build APIs for data processing and database querying.
5. **Facilitate User Interaction**: Design a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for file uploads and data retrieval.
6. **Ensure Accessibility**: The entire process should be accessible online, with no local dependency.
7. **Containerization and Deployment**: Dockerize the components and host them online to ensure scalability and ease of deployment.
8. **Documentation and Version Control**: Provide thorough documentation and maintain code with GitHub.

## Data Sources

2. **PDF Documents**: These are the three PDF files given.
3. **CSV Files**: Data files generated after processing PDF documents and webpages, containing structured information ready to be loaded into Snowflake.
4. **Grobid Output**: The result of processing the three PDF files through the Grobid tool, as .txt files, representing extracted data.
5. **Snowflake Datasets**: Pre-existing datasets within Snowflake used for validation or augmentation of the extracted data.
6.  **AWS Services**: (**S3 Buckets**) Raw and processed data storage.

## Pre requisites

The prerequisites for undertaking the described project would likely include:

1. **API Development with FastAPI**: Proficiency in developing robust APIs with FastAPI, including route creation, request handling, and response formatting.
2. **Data Orchestration with Airflow**: Familiarity with Airflow for workflow orchestration, including creating DAGs, operators, and understanding task dependencies.
3. **Streamlit Web Application**: Experience in building interactive web applications using Streamlit, integrating backend services, and managing user inputs.
4. **AWS Services**: Understanding of AWS services, particularly S3 for file storage and operations.
5. **Containerization with Docker**: Practical knowledge of creating, managing, and deploying Docker containers for application and environment encapsulation.
6. **Version Control with GitHub**: Experience with Git for version control, including committing changes, merging branches, and resolving conflicts on GitHub.
7. **Documentation with Google Codelabs**: Ability to create informative and clear documentation using Google Codelabs, providing step-by-step guides and explanations.
